    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; color:black;"> Who is Lana Del Rey?</h2>
    <div class="bio" >Lana Del Rey (aka Lizzy Grant) was born as Elizabeth Woolridge
        Grant on June 21, 1985, in New York City. Del Rey&#39;s parents were
        working in advertising in New York City when she was born, but left
        that life behind to move to Lake Placid, New York, in the Adirondack
        Mountains when Del Rey was a baby. She grew up with a younger
        brother and sister. Her sister, photographer Caroline &quot;Chuck&quot; Grant,
        shot the Lust for Life album cover and has taken promotional photos
        of Del Rey. Lana Del Rey envisioned a Southern California dream
        world constructed out of sad girls and bad boys, manufactured
        melancholy, and genuine glamour, and then she came to embody this
        fantasy.
